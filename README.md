1)coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
Intercept, vehicle_lenght, ground_clearance

2)Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
There are more than one significant linear relationship, therefor would be determined by non-random chance. In that circumstances linear module cannot be flat line with a slope of 0.

3)Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
According to R-Squared value: 0.7149 and p-value: 5.35e-11,  our multiple linear regression modeel performed effectively.

1)The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
A: Standart deviation indicated how data points tend to be close/far to its mean.In the light of this information. Lot3's SD and Variance is far from the typical normal distribution. Therefor opposite to Lot1 and Lot2 Variance of Lot3 is not under 100 PSI for variance.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- Our Significance level for T test is 0.05 percent. Which means if P-value is above 0.05, it means we can say that there that two means are statistically similar.

Lot 1 - population $ Lot1 ▶️ statistically similar

Lot 2 - population $ Lot2 ▶️ statistically similar

Lot 3 - population $ Lot3 ▶️ statistically not similar
